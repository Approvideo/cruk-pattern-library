Welcome to the home of the [Cancer Research UK](http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/) Pattern Library!

The aim of this project is to provide a componentised approach to how we create interfaces in a consistent and efficient manner.

This documentation details the different components that are available for use in our Digital projects.

This work is Open Source, we care about the wider community and are grateful to be part of it. We both benefit from Open Source and wish to give back by sharing the sum of our research and work in crafting carefully thought out solutions (UX, Design and Implementation).

The work itself can be [forked over on GitHub]({{ site.github.repo }}).

More words to come...
